> Dynamo is an open source visual programming platform for designers.

### Welcome

You have just opened the Dynamo Primer, a comprehensive guide to visual programming in Autodesk Dynamo. This primer is an on-going project to share the fundamentals of programming. Topics include working with computational geometry, best practices for rules-based design, cross-disciplinary programming applications, and more with the Dynamo Platform.

The power of Dynamo can be found in a wide variety of design-related activities. Dynamo enables an expanding list of readily accessible ways for you to get started:

* **Explore** visual programming for the first time
* **Connect** workflows in various software
* **Engage** an active community of users, contributors, and developers
* **Develop** an open-source platform for continued improvement

In the midst of this activity and exciting opportunity for working with Dynamo, we need a document of the same caliber, the Dynamo Primer.

Refer to the [primer user guide](1\_introduction/2-primer-user-guide-dynamo-community-and-platform.md) to find out what you can expect to learn from this primer.

### Open Source
