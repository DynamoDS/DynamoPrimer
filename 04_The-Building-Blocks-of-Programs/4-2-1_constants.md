### 4.2.1 Constants

###π
*Pi* is a mathematical constant which represents the ratio of circle's circumference to its diameter.  The value is commonly used in trigonmetric functions and is one of the more prevalent constants used in parametric modeling.
###e
The number *e* is a mathematical constant which is based on the natural logarithm.  Like *pi*, *e* is an irrational number which is commonly used in mathematics. The number is fundamental to growth prediction, and shows itself often in the fields of biology and economics.
###The Golden Ratio -  φ
Another irrational constant, the golden ratio defines that two quantities are in the golden ratio if their ratio is the same as the ratio of their sum to the larger of the two quantities.  This ratio appears often in geometry and biological systems, and is considered for a wide-range of applications ranging from the practical to the aesthetic.
