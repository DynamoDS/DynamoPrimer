# Custom Nodes

Dynamo offers many Core Nodes for a wide range of visual programming tasks. Sometimes a quicker, more elegant, or more easily shared solution is to build your own Nodes. These can be reused among different projects, they make your graphs clearer and cleaner, and they can be pushed to the package manager and shared with the global Dynamo community.
