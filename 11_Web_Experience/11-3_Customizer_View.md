##The Customizer View

The Dynamo Customizer view allows others to interact with your Dynamo scripts on the web via a simplified, curated interface consisting of inputs such as sliders, numbers, and booleans. 

By condensing complex graphs into a simple interface, the Customizer view makes your scripts accessible to a wider community of users who may not be familiar with Dynamo, Visual Programming, or 3D modeling. Anyone with an Autodesk account can access your Dynamo script in a Customizer View through a shared link, allowing them to interact with your script without a Dynamo license.

In the Customizer view, users can export geometry as an STL mesh for rapid prototyping, or as a Dynamo file.
