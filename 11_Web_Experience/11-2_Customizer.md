##The Customizer View

The Dynamo Customizer allows you to publish Dynamo scripts to the web for others to interact with via a pared down interface consisting of inputs such as sliders, numbers, and booleans. 

By condensing complex graphs into a simple interface, the Customizer makes your scripts accessible to a wider community of users who may not be familiar with Dynamo, Visual Programming, or 3D modeling. Anyone with an Autodesk account can access your Customizer through a shared link, allowing them to interact with your script without a Dynamo license.

The Customizer also allows users to export geometry as an STL mesh for rapid prototyping, or as a Dynamo file.

###Customizer UI

The Customizer view consists of a menu bar, a flyout menu containing a description of the file and user inputs, and a 3D view, similar to the Dynamo workspace:
