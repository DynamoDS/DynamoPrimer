# What is Dynamo & How Does It Work?

Dynamo is a [visual programming ](broken-reference/)application that can be downloaded and run in either stand-alone "Sandbox" mode or as a plug-in for other software like Revit, FormIt or Civil 3D.

### The Process

Dynamo enables us to work within a Visual Programming process wherein we connect elements together to define the relationships and the sequences of actions that compose custom algorithms. We can use our algorithms for a wide array of applications, from processing data to generating geometry, all in real-time and without writing a lick of `code`.

### Connecting Nodes and Wires

Nodes and Wires are the key components in Dynamo to support a [visual programming](../a\_appendix/a-1\_visual-programming-and-dynamo.md) process. It help establish strong visual and systemic relationships between the parts of a design. Using simple mouse-click to connect the Nodes easily while developing and optimizing your design workflow.

## What can Dynamo Achieve?

From using Visual Programming for project workflows to developing customized tools, Dynamo is an integral aspect of a wide variety of exciting applications.
