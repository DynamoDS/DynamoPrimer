**DesignScript Guide**

Programming languages are created to express ideas, usually involving logic and calculation. In addition to these objectives, the Dynamo textual language (formerly DesignScript) has been created to express design intentions. It is generally recognized that computational designing is exploratory, and Dynamo tries to support this: we hope you find the language flexible and fast enough to take a design from concept, through design iterations, to your final form. This manual is structured to give a user with no knowledge of either programming or architectural geometry full exposure to a variety of topics in these two intersecting disciplines.

**The Dynamo Primer Project**

The Dynamo Primer is an open source project, initiated by Matt Jezyk and the Dynamo Development team at Autodesk. The first version of the primer was developed by Mode Lab. To contribute, fork the repo, add your content, and submit a pull request.

**Zero Touch Plugin Development for Dynamo**

This page outlines the process of developing a custom Dynamo node in C# using the "Zero Touch" interface. In most cases, C# static methods and Classes can be imported without modification. If your library only needs to call functions, and not construct new objects, this can be achieved very easily with static methods. When Dynamo loads your DLL, it will strip off the namespace of your classes, and expose all static methods as nodes.

**Python for Beginners**

Python is an interpreted, interactive, object-oriented programming language. It incorporates modules, exceptions, dynamic typing, very high level dynamic data types, and classes. Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to various window systems, and is extensible in C or C++. It is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface. Finally, Python is portable: it runs on many Unix variants, on the Mac, and on Windows 2000 and later. The Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Python links to other introductory tutorials and resources for learning Python.

**Wolfram MathWorld**

MathWorld is an online mathematics resource, assembled by Eric W. Weisstein with assistance from thousands of contributors. Since its contents first appeared online in 1995, MathWorld has emerged as a nexus of mathematical information in both the mathematics and educational communities. Its entries are extensively referenced in journals and books spanning all educational levels.
