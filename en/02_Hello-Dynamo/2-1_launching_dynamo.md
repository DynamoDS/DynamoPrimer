## Installing and Launching Dynamo

Dynamo is an active open-source development project with downloadable installers for both official and pre-release, i.e.. "daily build" versions. Download the official release to get started, or contribute to what Dynamo becomes through the daily builds or GitHub project.

### Downloading

To download the official released version of Dynamo, visit the [Dynamo website](http://dynamobim.com/). Start the download immediately by clicking from the homepage or browse to the dedicated download page.

> 1. Select the Components you want to install

Here we need to decide if we want to include the components that connect Dynamo to other installed applications such as Revit. For more information on the Dynamo Platform, see **Chapter 1.2**.

### Launching

To launch Dynamo, browse to \\Program Files\Dynamo\Dynamo Revit\x.y, then select DynamoSandbox.exe. This will open the stand-alone version and present Dynamo's _Start Page_. On this page, we see the standard menus and toolbar as well as a collection of shortcuts that allow us to access file functionality or access additional resources.
