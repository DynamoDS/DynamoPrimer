# Python

​​Python is a widely-used programming language whose popularity has a lot to do with its style of syntax. It's highly readable, which makes it easier to learn than many other languages. Python supports modules and packages and can be embedded into existing applications. For information about how to get up and running with Python, a good resource is the ["Getting Started"](https://www.python.org/about/gettingstarted/) page on [Python.org](https://www.python.org)
