# Geometry for Computational Design

As a Visual Programming environment, Dynamo enables you to craft the way that data is processed. Data is numbers or text, but so is Geometry. As understood by the Computer, Geometry - or sometimes called Computational Geometry - is the data we can use to create beautiful, intricate, or performance-driven models. To do so, we need to understand the ins and outs of the various types of Geometry we can use.
